# Simple Chat App

This project aims to develop a simple, two-way communication chat application. The application facilitates message exchange between a client on a frontend website and an administrator on a backend server. It leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and is styled with Tailwind CSS. Real-time communication is implemented using Socket.IO. The project includes hosting for both frontend and backend components to ensure accessibility and functionality.

## Features

- Two-Way Communication: Allows real-time messaging between clients and administrators.
- Real-Time Updates: Uses Socket.IO for live message exchange.
- Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look.
- MERN Stack Integration: Combines MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
- Hosted Solution: Both frontend and backend are hosted for public accessibility.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

 - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
 - Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
 - Socket.IO: Library for real-time web applications.

### Backend
